#Dir App#
Usage of this golang app is to list and reach to the file, just like `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 3000`.

I used [martini](https://github.com/codegangsta/martini) as the web framework.

It works at default port 3000 as http://localhost:3000

I cross compiled it for Windows, Mac OS and Linux by [gox](https://github.com/mitchellh/gox).
You can get the executable file from [here](https://github.com/gejigeji/golang_exercise/tree/master/bin)

It works like that:

It's just a exercise of golang.
